## Content Culture of Each Country's Top Youtube Creators

### Description:
Our project is an analysis of YouTube channel popularity and success of categories of YouTube content based on country. We sorted through the top 1000 YouTube channels based on subscriber amount,country, and content channel category to analyze popularity of different YouTube content.  
  
Alex: Through pandas dataframe editing, I pulled our cleaned data from the csv, split it into various dictionaries, and exported the dictionaries into js files for easy use for charting through plotly. Through the use of d3.js, I created a deopdown menu allowing users to select any country included in our data and would then display a pie chart displaying the distribution of the various categories of content that the top channels for that country fell into, and a bar chart that displayed the channel names, subscriber counts and respective categories for each channel that operates in that country.
